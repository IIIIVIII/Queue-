The APIs given below describe the required methods in each class that will be tested.
You may need additional methods or classes that will not be directly tested but may be
necessary to complete the assignment. Keep in mind that anything that does not need to
be public should generally be kept private (instance variables, helper methods, etc.).
Unless otherwise stated in this handout, you are welcome (and encouraged) to add
to/alter the provided java files as well as create new java files as needed.
